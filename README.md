## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Unbox your Raspberry Pi and accessories**  
   - Check all components are present: Pi board, case, power supply, HDMI cable, microSD card, heatsinks,fan.


2. **Attach heatsinks (optional but recommended)**  
   - Remove protective backing and place heatsinks on the CPU, RAM, and USB.

3. **Insert Raspberry Pi into the case**  
   - Open the case and carefully place the board inside.  
   
   - (TIP): Remove the first two layers of the case to make it easier to put the raspberry pi in it.

5. **Insert the microSD card**  
   - The microSD card will later hold your operating system (setup comes in later steps).

4. **Attach Fan**  
   - Grab Fan wires which typically usually have red (positive) and black (ground).
   - Plug in fan into GPIO header(this has 40 pins).

6. **Power up**  
   - Connect the power supply and switch it on.  
   - Your Raspberry Pi should light up and be ready for the OS setup.
